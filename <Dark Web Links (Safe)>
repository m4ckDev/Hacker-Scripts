# 🕸️ What Is the Dark Web?

The “dark web” refers to websites that are only accessible through **Tor**, a privacy-focused network that hides your IP address by routing your traffic through multiple encrypted relays.

`.onion` sites exist **outside the regular internet**, and you need special tools to reach them.

The dark web is **not illegal** — but many activities on it are.  
This guide covers **only the legal side**.

# 🧭 How To Access .onion Sites (Step-By-Step)

### **1. Download Tor Browser (official site only)**
**Never** download Tor from anywhere else — cloned installers are filled with malware.

Official Tor Browser:
https://www.torproject.org/download/


### **2. Open Tor Browser**
Once installed:
- Launch Tor Browser  
- Wait for it to connect to the Tor network  
- You now have access to `.onion` domains

### **3. Enter an .onion link directly**
Example:http://protonirockerxow.onion


Regular browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari) **cannot** open `.onion` links.
